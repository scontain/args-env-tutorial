# In this exercise, we use a public CAS that is accessible for development.
# This CAS has the name scone-cas.cf
# We store this name in the environment variable SCONE_CAS_ADDR

# The CAS instance runs in debug mode and the hardware &
# firmware seems to have some issues.
# We can use --help to see what we can do about this

# In case we have multiple CAS instances, we can set a default instance that the 
# CLI should use with the command scone cas set-default.

# let us look at the list of trusted CAS instances.
# The default CAS is marked with "*"
# In this case, we have attested only one CAS instance.
